Interview Coding Exercises
==========================

I decided to create and populate repository with my coding exercises. 
It can be used later to refresh algorithms skills.

Python
------

One can use runner.py in each folder to run testcases.

Java
----

Run via Maven (example):
`mvn package
java -cp javacode/target/javacode-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.shenkao.exercises.medium.LinkedListCycleIImedium142.Runner`
