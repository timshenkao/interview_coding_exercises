# interview_coding_exercises
I decided to create and populate repository with my coding exercises. 
It can be used later to refresh algorithms skills.

Code for all exercises is self-isolated: there is no auxiliary folders / libraries with functions, no interdependencies
between folders / exercises.
One can use runner.py in each folder to run testcases.
