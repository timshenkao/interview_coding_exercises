# Factory Design Pattern is a creational pattern that provides a way to create objects without specifying the exact
# class of object that will be created. It encapsulates object creation logic in a separate method or class,
# promoting loose coupling and enhancing flexibility. This pattern is particularly useful when the type of object to
# instantiate is determined at runtime or when you want to centralize object creation logic.

# Benefits of the Factory Pattern
#     Centralized Object Creation: All object creation logic is in one place, making it easier to maintain and modify.
#     Decoupling: The client code depends only on the abstract interface and the factory, not on concrete classes.
#     Extensibility: New classes can be added with minimal changes to the factory and no changes to the client code.
#     Improved Readability: Using a factory makes the code more expressive, as the client doesnâ€™t need to deal with
#         instantiation details.
#
# Drawbacks of the Factory Pattern
#     Increased Complexity: For simple systems, a factory might add unnecessary overhead compared to direct instantiation.
#     Single Point of Maintenance: The factory must be updated whenever a new subclass is added, which can become
#         cumbersome if many types are supported.
#     Potential for Overuse: Overusing factories for trivial cases can lead to bloated code.


# When to Use the Factory Pattern
#     When the type of object to create depends on runtime conditions (e.g., user input, configuration, or data).
#     When you want to centralize object creation logic to improve maintainability.
#     When you need to decouple client code from concrete classes.
#
# Real-world applications:
#     Creating database connections (e.g., SQL vs. NoSQL based on configuration).
#     Instantiating UI components (e.g., buttons or windows for different operating systems).
#     Handling different file formats (e.g., JSON, XML, CSV parsers).
