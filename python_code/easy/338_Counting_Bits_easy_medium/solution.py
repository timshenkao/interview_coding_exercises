# 338. Counting Bits https://leetcode.com/problems/counting-bits/
# Given an integer n, return an array ans of length n + 1 such that for each i (0 <= i <= n), ans[i] is the number
# of 1's in the binary representation of i.
# 0 <= n <= 10^5
# Follow up:
# - It is very easy to come up with a solution with a runtime of O(n log n). Can you do it in linear time O(n) and
#       possibly in a single pass?
# - Can you do it without using any built-in function (i.e., like __builtin_popcount in C++)?
