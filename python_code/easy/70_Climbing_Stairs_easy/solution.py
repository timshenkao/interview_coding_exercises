Approach 1: 2D DPÂ¶
Time: O(n)
Space: O(n)


class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        # dp[i] := the number of ways to climb to the i-th stair
        dp = [1, 1] + [0] * (n - 1)

        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]

        return dp[n]

Approach 2: 1D DP
Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)


class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        prev1 = 1  # dp[i - 1]
        prev2 = 1  # dp[i - 2]

        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            dp = prev1 + prev2
            prev2 = prev1
            prev1 = dp

        return prev1
