# 347. Top K Frequent Elements https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/
# Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k most frequent elements. You may return the answer in any
# order.
# 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
# -10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
# k is in the range [1, the number of unique elements in the array].
# It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.
# Your algorithm's time complexity must be better than O(n log n), where n is the array's size.
