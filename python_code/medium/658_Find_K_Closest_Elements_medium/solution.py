# 658. Find K Closest Elements https://leetcode.com/problems/find-k-closest-elements/
# Given a sorted integer array arr, two integers k and x, return the k closest integers to x in the array. The result
# should also be sorted in ascending order.
# An integer a is closer to x than an integer b if:
#       |a - x| < |b - x|, or
#       |a - x| == |b - x| and a < b
# 1 <= k <= arr.length
# 1 <= arr.length <= 10^4
# arr is sorted in ascending order
# -10^4 <= arr[i], x <= 10^4
