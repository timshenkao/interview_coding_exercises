# 8. String to Integer (atoi) https://leetcode.com/problems/string-to-integer-atoi/
# Implement the myAtoi(string s) function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer (similar to
# C/C++'s atoi function).
# The algorithm for myAtoi(string s) is as follows:
#       Read in and ignore any leading whitespace.
#       Check if the next character (if not already at the end of the string) is '-' or '+'. Read this character in if
#       it is either. This determines if the final result is negative or positive respectively. Assume the result is
#       positive if neither is present.
#       Read in next the characters until the next non-digit character or the end of the input is reached.
#       The rest of the string is ignored.
#       Convert these digits into an integer (i.e. "123" -> 123, "0032" -> 32). If no digits were read, then the
#       integer is 0. Change the sign as necessary (from step 2).
#       If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [-2^31, 2^31 - 1], then clamp the integer so that it
#       remains in the range. Specifically, integers less than -2^31 should be clamped to -2^31, and integers greater
#       than 2^31 - 1 should be clamped to 2^31 - 1.
# Return the integer as the final result.
# Note:
# Only the space character ' ' is considered a whitespace character.
# Do not ignore any characters other than the leading whitespace or the rest of the string after the digits.
# 0 <= s.length <= 200
# s consists of English letters (lower-case and upper-case), digits (0-9), ' ', '+', '-', and '.'.
